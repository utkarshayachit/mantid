Description
-----------

This algorithm is to import data file generated by SPICE, a 
data acquisition software used in HFIR ,
and record the data and run information to TableWorkspaces.

Format of SPICE data file
#########################

There are two parts of content in SPICE data file. 
One is the run information, in which line that starts with #. 

In most cases, the run information is give as 

# run info name = run info value

The other is the experimental data.  
The first item is an integer as the index of experimental data point. 

Output Worskpaces
#################

Two table worskpaces will be exported from the algorith. 

'OutputWorkspace' is the table workspace containing the measured experimental data. 
Each row of it contains all the measured parameters of one data point.  

'RunInfoWorkspace' is the table workspace that 
stores the run information, such as scan number, IPTS, sample information and etc. 


Usage
-----

**Example - load a SPICE .dat file:**

.. testcode:: ExLoadHB2AData

  LoadSPICEAscii(Filename="HB2A_exp0231_scan0001.dat", 
        IntSampleLogNames="Sum of Counts, scan, mode, experiment_number",
        FloatSampleLogNames="samplemosaic, preset_value, Full Width Half-Maximum, Center of Mass", 
        OutputWorkspace="HB2A_0231_0001_Data", 
        RunInfoWorkspace="HB2A_0231_Info")
  datatbws = mtd['HB2A_0231_0001_Data'] 
  infows = mtd['HB2A_0231_Info']

  print "Number of measuring points = %d" % (datatbws.rowCount())
  print "Number of columns in data workspace = %d" % (datatbws.columnCount())
  print "Number of run information = %d" % (len(infows.getRun().getProperties()))
  print "Sum of Counts = %d" % (infows.getRun().getProperty("Sum of Counts").value)
  print "Center of Mass = %.5f +/- %.5f" % (infows.getRun().getProperty("Center of Mass").value, 
      infows.getRun().getProperty("Center of Mass.error").value)

.. testcleanup:: ExLoadHB2AData

  DeleteWorkspace(infows)
  DeleteWorkspace(datatbws)

Output:

.. testoutput:: ExLoadHB2AData

  Number of measuring points = 61
  Number of columns in data workspace = 70
  Number of run information = 35
  Sum of Counts = 1944923
  Center of Mass = 9.00076 +/- 0.00921
