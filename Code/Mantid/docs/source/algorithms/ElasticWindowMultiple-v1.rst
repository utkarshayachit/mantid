Description
-----------

This algorithm performs the ElasticWindow algorithm over a set of workspaces
provided as a workspace group, the binning of each workspace must match.

The Q and Q Suared output workspaces show the output of ElasticWindow for each
input workspace, the ELF workspace shows the data transposed with the X axis in
either sample temperature or run number of temperature is not available.

The ELT workspace shows the normalisation of the ELF workspace to run with the
lowest sample temperature.
